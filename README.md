# 🧠 Deep Learning Notes

Welcome to my Deep Learning journey.

This repository documents my structured learning path through the fundamentals and advanced topics of Deep Learning.  
The goal is not only to understand the theory, but to implement every major algorithm from scratch using PyTorch.

---

## 🚀 Objective

I am systematically studying and implementing the core concepts and architectures of Deep Learning, including:

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Backpropagation
- Optimization Algorithms
- Regularization Techniques
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- LSTM & GRU
- Attention Mechanisms
- Transformers
- Modern Deep Learning Architectures

This repository represents hands-on experimentation, implementation, and continuous improvement.

## 🏗️ Learning Philosophy

- Understand the mathematics behind each algorithm
- Implement models from scratch
- Train on real datasets
- Analyze performance
- Optimize and improve architectures
- Build intuition through experimentation

Deep Learning is not just about using libraries — it’s about understanding how models learn.
